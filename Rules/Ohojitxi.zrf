  (description "On his turn a player picks up the seeds of one of his holes and then \
distributes them, one by one, counterclockwise into the ensuing holes of \
his half of the board. \\
A move ends after one sowing. \\
The contents of a hole are captured, when the last seed makes a four. \
Any fours in a continuous line preceding this hole (on the player's own half \
of the board) are also captured.")
  (history "Ohojichi is played in the Agbo region of the Ivory Coast. It is a very unusual \
mancala game, which seems to be related to Lontu-holu of the Bush Negroes \
in Suriname. The game has been spelled Ohojitxi, when it was first described by \
Jordi Climent Tondo in 2009, but this is a Catalanisation of the Ivorian spelling.")
